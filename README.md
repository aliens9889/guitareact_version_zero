# GuitaReact

It is the first version about this project. This version will show you the song randomly once you click the button.

Will show the songs to play (if you are a guitar player of course) randomly.

Another point to add is once the song appears, it won't appear again, so you will be sure the next song will be a new one. And if you played all the songs you have the opportunity to star over if you want to.

To run the project first you have to install the dependencies

```
yarn install
```

After the previous step you can run the project with this command

```
yarn start
```

Enjoy your playlist with GuitaReact!
